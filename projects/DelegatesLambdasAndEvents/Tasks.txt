Tasks

Create a console application.
Create a class, which allows to bubble-sort a matrix of integers (do not use System.Array methods) in order to arrange matrix rows:


in ascending (descending) order by sums of matrix row elements
in ascending (descending) order by maximum element in a matrix row;
in ascending (descending) order by minimum element in a matrix row;
USE DELEGATES with STRATEGY PATTERN (comparison type and order type should be passed by user. You can hardcode demo-matrix)


Develop a Countdown class, which implements the capability to transmit a message to any subscriber who subscribes to the event after the appointed time (waiting time is provided by the user).
You can use the Thread.Sleep() method to create a wait effect. Provide the possibility of subscribing to an event in several classes.
